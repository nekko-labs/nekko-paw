# Open Paw relay

A dumb, end-to-end-encrypted pipe that pairs a remote client (your phone) with a
local agent (your desktop) by room code, so a phone can drive your local model
with no inbound ports. The relay never sees conversation content — only the
routing envelope and content-free control frames.

```bash
npm run build -w @open-paw/relay
npm run start -w @open-paw/relay      # ws://0.0.0.0:4400/relay
```

Env: `OPENPAW_RELAY_PORT` (4400), `OPENPAW_RELAY_HOST` (0.0.0.0).

## Remote push (optional)

When a desktop finishes a run, it sends a content-free `notify` control frame.
If the paired phone is **offline**, the relay sends it a push notification using
the token the phone registered (`register-push` frame). Configure APNs:

| Env var | What |
| --- | --- |
| `APNS_KEY_P8` | Contents of the APNs auth key `.p8` (PEM, with newlines) |
| `APNS_KEY_ID` | The key's 10-char Key ID |
| `APNS_TEAM_ID` | Apple Team ID |
| `APNS_BUNDLE_ID` | App bundle id (default `dev.nekkolabs.openpaw`) |
| `APNS_PRODUCTION` | `1` for the production APNs host (default: sandbox) |

Without these the relay runs normally and just logs that push is disabled.
**Android (FCM)** delivery is a documented TODO (needs a Google service account).

The privacy model holds: the push body is generic ("Your task finished"); the
relay only learns *that* a run completed, never its contents.
